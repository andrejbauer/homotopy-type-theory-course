# Homotopy (type) theory

A doctoral course on homotopy theory and homotopy type theory given by
[Andrej Bauer](http://www.andrej.com) and [Jaka Smrekar](https://www.fmf.uni-lj.si/~smrekar/)
at the [Faculty of mathematics and Physics](http://www.fmf.uni-lj.si/), University of Ljubljana,
in the Spring of 2019.

In this course we first overview the basics of classical homotopy theory. Starting with
the notion of locally trivial bundles, we motivate the classical definitions of
fibrations, from which we proceed to identify the abstract strucure of Quillen model
categories. We outline the basics of abstract homotopy theory in a Quillen model.

In the second part we introduce homotopy type theory from the point of view of classical
homotopy theory, deliberately avoiding the connections between homotopy type theory and
computer science. We show how type theory can be used to carry out homotopy-theoretic
arguments abstractly and "synthetically". The fact that any construction expressed in type
theory is homotopy invariant is both a blessing and a curse: a blessing because it never
lets us step outside of the realm of homotopy theory, and a curse because we never
step outside of the realm of homotopy theory.

## Course administration

We meet weekly on Tuesdays from 14:00 to 16:00 in lecture room 3.06 at the Mathematics
department.

The take-home exam is now available in [`exam.pdf`](./exam.pdf).

### Homotopy theory

There is a wealth of resources available on the topic of homotopy theory. The following literature is recommended as reading material:

### Homotopy type theory

Being a new topic, homotopy type theory is still developing. Consequently, reading
material and resources are a bit more fluid and scattered. A central resource is the "HoTT book", although it is hard-going for the unexperienced:

* Univalent foundations program, [Homotopy type theory: Univalent foundations of mathematics](https://homotopytypetheory.org/book/)

The following introductory notes are targeted at teaching homotopy type theory:

* Egbert Rijke, [Introduction to Homotopy Type Theory](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/erijke/hott/), a graduate course taught at Carnegie Mellon University. The accompanying [lecture notes](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/erijke/hott/hott_intro.pdf) is recommended as reading material.

* [Martín Escardó](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~mhe/), [Introduction to Univalent Foundations of Mathematics with Agda](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~mhe/HoTT-UF-in-Agda-Lecture-Notes/HoTT-UF-Agda.html) is a set of lecture notes written in literal Agda (text interspersed with [Agda code](http://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda)). It explains the basics very thoroughly and very well. You may safely ignore the fact that it is all formalized and computer-checked, altought you may also be interested in learning how to use Agda, in which case you can consult the [lecture notes GitHub repository](https://github.com/martinescardo/HoTT-UF-Agda-Lecture-Notes).

Here are some additional resources:

* [Daniel Grayson](https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/~dan/): [An introduction to univalent foundations for mathematicians](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.01477.pdf), targeted at a general mathematical audience,
* [Michael Shulman](https://home.sandiego.edu/~shulman/): [Homotopy type theory: the logic of space](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03007),
  worth reading if you would like to expand your understanding of "space",
* [Steve Awodey](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/awodey/) and [Michael Warren](http://mawarren.net): [Homotopy theoretic models of identity types](https://arxiv.org/abs/0709.0248), the original paper introducing the interpreation of identity types in Quillen model categories.
